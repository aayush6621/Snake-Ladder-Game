Here's a Snakes and ladders board game to play with your friends and family.

How to play:

Game is always started by PLAYER - 1.
Take it in turns to roll the dice.
To throw a dice, you have to press the 'THROW DICE' button.
Your counter is automatically moved forward the number of spaces shown on the dice.
If the dice shows a six, its your turn again to throw the dice.
If your counter lands at the bottom of a ladder, you can move up to the top of the ladder.
If your counter lands on the head of a snake, you must slide down to the bottom of the snake.
The first player to get to the space that says 'home' is the winner.

If you play a 'SINGLE PLAYER' game, you have to throw your dice, the system automatically throws its dice.

Have fun !!!
